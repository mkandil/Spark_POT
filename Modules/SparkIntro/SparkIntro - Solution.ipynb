It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for processing structured data, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Spark Streaming.\n",

    "Apache Spark uses an abstraction for working with data called a Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD). An RDD is a collection of elements that can be operated on in parallel. RDDs are immutable, so you can't update the data in them. To update data in an RDD, you must create a new RDD. In Apache Spark, all work is done by creating new RDDs, transforming existing RDDs, or using RDDs to compute results. When working with RDDs, the Spark driver application automatically distributes the work across the cluster.\n",

    "You can construct RDDs by parallelizing existing Python collections (lists), by manipulating RDDs, or by manipulating files in HDFS or any other storage system.\n",
